# Python Microservice Boilerplate

[![Python application test with GitHub Actions](https://github.com/skyler-saville/python-microservice-boilerplate/actions/workflows/devops.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/skyler-saville/python-microservice-boilerplate/actions/workflows/devops.yml)

**Welcome to the Python Microservice Boilerplate!**

This boilerplate is designed to kickstart your microservices development with a robust structure and common best practices. It is meant to be forked and used as a submodule in larger projects consisting of multiple microservices that rely on this boilerplate for consistent development and integration.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this boilerplate is to streamline the development of microservices and ensure consistency across a project's architecture. With this boilerplate, you can quickly set up a new microservice with the following key features:

- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **Docker**: Containerization for consistent deployment and scaling.
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated checks for code issues such as lint errors and code formatting.
- **Python Fire CLI**: A CLI generator for testing the microservice's logic.
- **Unit Testing**: Out-of-the-box testing setup with pytest.

## How to Use

To get started with this boilerplate, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository**: Fork this repository to your own GitHub account.

2. **Create a New Project**: In your organization or account, create a new GitHub repository that represents your microservice project.

3. **Add Boilerplate as a Submodule**: Add this repository as a submodule to your new project. Submodules allow you to incorporate the boilerplate's code into your project while maintaining a separate repository for your microservice.

   ```bash
   git submodule add https://github.com/your-account/python-microservice-boilerplate.git your-microservice

## Repeat for Multiple Microservices

If you have multiple microservices in your project, you can fork and add this repository as a submodule for each one, allowing you to maintain them independently.

## Customize the Boilerplate

In your new project, customize the code and configuration files within the `your-microservice` directory to implement the specific functionality of your microservice.

## Development and Integration

Continue developing and integrating your microservices within your project. You can add and manage multiple microservices, each serving different purposes and functionality.

## Orchestration with Docker Compose

Assemble your microservices into a cohesive architecture using Docker Compose, allowing you to manage and deploy the complete ecosystem.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized for clarity and ease of development. The `mylib` directory serves as the core logic for your microservice, featuring submodules for data access, business logic, and API handling. Additionally, the boilerplate provides utility modules, testing directories, configuration management, and custom exception handling.

## Continuous Integration

Continuous Integration (CI) is set up to automatically check your code for lint errors and code formatting. This ensures that your microservices adhere to best practices.

## Additional considerations to keep in mind for the future:

1. **Security**: While the boilerplate focuses on functionality and development, consider adding security best practices, such as authentication and authorization mechanisms, input validation, and security headers, to ensure that your microservices are protected from common security threats.

2. **Documentation**: Providing extensive documentation for developers is crucial. This includes both high-level documentation explaining the architecture and design of the microservices and low-level documentation within code files, docstrings, and comments.

3. **Monitoring and Logging**: As your microservices evolve, implementing a comprehensive logging and monitoring system will help you troubleshoot issues and optimize performance. Tools like Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, or Sentry can be valuable for this purpose.

4. **Error Handling**: Extend your boilerplate to include more robust error handling and meaningful error messages, making it easier to identify issues in production environments.

5. **Caching**: Depending on the use cases of your microservices, implementing caching mechanisms can significantly improve performance. Consider incorporating caching solutions like Redis or Memcached.

6. **Load Balancing and Scalability**: As your microservices grow, load balancing and auto-scaling are crucial for handling increased traffic. Ensure that your microservices can horizontally scale with tools like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm.

7. **API Versioning**: Think about how to handle API versioning. As microservices evolve, it's essential to maintain backward compatibility for existing consumers while introducing new features.

8. **Testing Strategies**: Consider different testing strategies, such as integration testing and end-to-end testing, to ensure that the interactions between microservices and the entire system work as expected.

9. **Data Management**: Think about the data storage and management strategies for your microservices, especially if you have microservices with different data requirements. This might involve various databases, object storage, or data caching solutions.

10. **Deployment and Continuous Delivery**: Implement deployment and continuous delivery pipelines to automate the release process, making it easier to roll out changes to production.

11. **Service Discovery**: If your microservices need to discover and communicate with each other, consider service discovery solutions like Consul or etcd.

12. **Centralized Configuration**: Implement a centralized configuration management system to manage application settings and environment variables for all your microservices.

13. **API Gateways**: As your architecture becomes more complex, you may need an API gateway to manage routing, authentication, and other cross-cutting concerns.

14. **Service Mesh**: For advanced microservices architectures, you might consider a service mesh like Istio or Linkerd to handle advanced traffic management, security, and observability.

Remember that your boilerplate can evolve over time to incorporate these elements as your project's needs change and grow. Starting with a solid foundation is an excellent approach, and you can iteratively improve it as you encounter new challenges and requirements in your microservices project.


## Contributions

We encourage contributions to this boilerplate. Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or suggest improvements that can benefit the broader microservices community.

By forking and using this boilerplate, you can streamline your microservices development while ensuring consistency and maintainability. Building a robust microservices architecture has never been easier, and you can do it by forking this repository for each of your microservices!
