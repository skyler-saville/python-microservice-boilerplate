# `mylib` Directory Structure

The `mylib` directory is the heart of your microservice, containing the primary logic and functionality. It is thoughtfully organized to promote modularity, code organization, and maintainability. Below, we provide detailed explanations for each sub-directory and key files:

## `__init__.py`

An empty Python file that initializes the `mylib` module if needed. Developers can use this file for any module-level initialization code.

## `logic/`

The `logic` directory serves as the central hub for the core logic of your microservice. It can be further subdivided into specific submodules based on the functionality of your microservice:

### `data_access.py`

- **Purpose:** This module contains code responsible for data access, such as database interactions or data retrieval. It is where developers implement functions to interact with data sources.

### `business_logic.py`

- **Purpose:** The `business_logic.py` module is dedicated to your microservice's core business logic. It encompasses the primary processing of data, the implementation of specific operations, and the application's unique functionality.

### `api_handling.py`

- **Purpose:** The `api_handling.py` module is responsible for handling API requests and generating responses. Developers use this module to define API endpoints, route handlers, and the behavior of the microservice's API.

## `utils/`

The `utils` directory is home to utility functions and helper classes that can be reused across different parts of your microservice. It promotes code reusability and simplifies development.

- **Purpose:** To provide a central location for common functions and utility classes that can streamline development and make code more maintainable.

## `tests/`

The `tests` directory focuses on unit testing for the components within the `mylib` directory. Each submodule within the `logic` directory should have corresponding test files:

### `test_data_access.py`

- **Purpose:** This module is for unit tests related to the `data_access.py` module. Developers write tests to ensure that data access functions function correctly.

### `test_business_logic.py`

- **Purpose:** The `test_business_logic.py` module is dedicated to unit tests for the `business_logic.py` module. Developers create tests to validate the correctness of their microservice's business logic.

### `test_api_handling.py`

- **Purpose:** This module contains unit tests for the `api_handling.py` module. Developers write tests to confirm that API endpoints and request handling behave as expected.

## `config/`

The `config` directory is for managing configuration settings, constants, and environment variables that affect your microservice's behavior:

- **Purpose:** It serves as a central repository for configuration management, making it simple to adjust settings without modifying code.

## `exceptions/`

The `exceptions` directory is intended for custom exception classes. If your microservice requires custom error handling, this is where you define unique exceptions:

- **Purpose:** To define custom exception classes tailored to your microservice's specific needs. These custom exceptions can be used to gracefully handle exceptional scenarios.

This structured layout provides a clear separation of concerns, encourages modularity, and enables developers to effectively maintain and extend the functionality of the microservice. To ensure consistency and help developers contribute effectively, it is recommended to adhere to this structure and include a custom `README.md` within the `mylib` directory to guide developers on structuring their code.
